# [nodejs-babel-basic-boilerplate](https://github.com/rgehan/nodejs-babel-basic-boilerplate)

This is a really simple starting NodeJS app. It makes use of Babel in order to support the latest features of the language.

Gulp is used to run the Babelization task, and dotenv is already "configured" (if that's a thing).

## Installation
```bash
npm install # or yarn install
```

## Usage
Put your code inside `src/`, and run `npm start # or yarn start`.

If everything's ok, your transpiled code is in `dist/`, and the app is running
